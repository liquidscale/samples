# Collaborative Todo App Sample

This is a sample to demonstrate the use of LQS stateful functional cluster to create a collaborative todo list application. This is a standalone app (external to the cluster) that uses the LQS cluster as backend. You can also use a version of the sample that is served by the cluster, which is simpler and give you access to plenty of server-side magic in your frontend app!
